## Proposal
Neural networks have historically been black-boxes; their inner working inscrutable to analysis. In this paper techniques to visualise the action of a neural network are explored. Using gradient ascent with regularization, input images that maximise the activation of a particular node in a convnet can be generated, and these provide insight into the way the neural network processes images by understanding excatly what each neuron has learned and thus what computation it performs. Adding to this we hope to explore the adversarial aspect of input engineering for convnets, creating images that differ imperceptibly from "good" images and yet are predicted incorrectly by the convnet with high confidence.
